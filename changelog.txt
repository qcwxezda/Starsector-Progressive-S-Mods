1.0.3 (dev)
----------
- Handled possible (but which should never happen) cyclic base ship chain.

1.0.2
----------
- Hotfix for persistence issue when adding S-mods/increasing limit from LunaLib refit button on ships that didn't already have the XP tracker hullmod.

1.0.1
----------
- Disabled and removed the legacy UI.
- Added LunaLib refit button to manage S-mods, if you have LunaLib. (Note: due to weirdness with stacking interfaces, clicking the increase S-mod limit button will close the S-mod interface when accessed directly from refit screen).
- No longer checks hullmod getUnapplicableReason for hullmods that are already installed on the variant.
- Fixed reserve XP not working correctly with Lunalib.
- Fixed increasing S-mod limit not working with the exact number of story points needed.
- Reserve XP can now be used to increase S-mod limit.
